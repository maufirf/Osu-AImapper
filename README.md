*Big thanks for all of the [Osu!Dev and community devs](http://discord.gg/ppy), [carykh](https://github.com/carykh),

# Osu-Automapper
Produces an Osu!Standard beatmap from a given track of song, the style of mapping is based on the given beatmap (that is already made)
using Artificial Intelligence.

Currently this is still in development and I'm personally still learning about Artificial Intelligence. Despite the
*Artificial Intelligence Introduction* course i went through last semester, i don't think my knowledge is sufficient enough
for this, that's why i'll keep learning albeit just by myself.

I'm not really thinking to open the development, but if you're interested to be involved, come and hang out to [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/4AQV9Q7) and let's talk about that.
