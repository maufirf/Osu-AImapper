Currently this is still in development and I'm personally still learning about Artificial Intelligence. Despite the
*Artificial Intelligence Introduction* course i went through last semester, i don't think my knowledge is sufficient enough
for this, that's why i'll keep learning albeit just by myself.

I'm not really thinking to open the development to public for now, but if you're interested to be involved, come and hang out to [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/4z5zwZ) and let's talk about that. Check the [most recent Osu! forum thread for Osu!Automapper](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/872388), which is very old lmao.

***NOTE:*** I'm in hiatus developing this for undetermined duration. My mental state is really not okay to keep continuing my hobby projects while also doing college stuff and working. Thanks for understanding!
